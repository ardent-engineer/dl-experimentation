# Deep Learning Experimentation - PyTorch Ultimate 2024

Welcome to the **dl-experimentation** repository! This project contains my implementations of the course assessments for the **PyTorch Ultimate 2024 - From Basics to Cutting-Edge Specialization** offered by Packt on Coursera. The repository serves as a portfolio of hands-on projects and experiments completed as part of the course, covering a wide range of deep learning concepts and techniques using PyTorch.

## Overview

This repository includes my solutions and implementations for the assignments and projects from the [PyTorch Ultimate 2024 Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/packt-pytorch-ultimate-2024---from-basics-to-cutting-edge). The specialization covers fundamental to advanced deep learning topics, including neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and more. Each implementation is designed to demonstrate practical applications of the concepts taught in the course.

## Course Details

The **PyTorch Ultimate 2024 - From Basics to Cutting-Edge Specialization** is a 3-course series offered by Packt on Coursera. It is designed for intermediate learners and covers:

- **Course 1**: Setting up PyTorch, building and training neural networks, and applying optimization techniques for real-world tasks.
- **Course 2**: Implementing classification models, CNNs for image/audio, object detection with YOLO, neural style transfer, and RNNs/LSTMs.
- **Course 3**: Building autoencoders, GANs, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and deploying models using Flask on Google Cloud.

**Key Skills Gained**:
- PyTorch and Python programming
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, GANs, Transformers)
- Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
- Model evaluation, optimization, and deployment
- Supervised and unsupervised learning

## Repository Features

- **Course Assessment Solutions**: Code implementations for assignments and projects from all three courses in the specialization.
- **Well-Documented Code**: Each script or notebook includes comments and explanations linking back to course concepts.
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world tasks such as image classification, object detection, and generative modeling.
- **Organized Structure**: Files are organized by course and topic for easy navigation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch and related deep learning libraries (e.g., torchvision)
- Jupyter Notebook (for .ipynb files)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Optional: Access to a GPU for faster training of deep learning models

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ardent-engineer/dl-experimentation.git
   cd dl-experimentation
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Explore the course-specific folders or notebooks in the `notebooks/` or `scripts/` directories.

### Usage

- Navigate to the folder corresponding to the course or topic (e.g., `course1/`, `course2/`, etc.).
- Follow the instructions in the individual README files or code comments for each assessment.
- Run the code using Jupyter Notebook or Python:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python scripts/courseX_assignmentY.py
   ```
